# Topic-Modelling
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular topic modeling technique to extract topics from a given corpus.
Topic modeling is a type of statistical modeling for discovering the abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents. 
Topic modelling scans a set of documents, detects word and phrase
patterns within them and helps the user to find the Abstract from set
of topics.
It builds a topic per document model and words per topic model,
using LDA algorithm.

-Steps for LDA Implementation:

1.Loading data and Data cleaning

2.Exploratory analysis

3.Preparing data for LDA analysis

4.LDA model training 

5.Analyzing LDA model results
